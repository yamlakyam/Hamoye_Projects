{"name":"footprint_nfa-2019-edition","title":"NFA 2019 Edition","description":"NFA 2019 National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts data set (1961-2016)\n\n---\n{\"editor\":\"markdown\"}\n---\n​@[youtube](https://youtu.be/_T5M3MiPfW4)\n\n-------------------\n\nOur National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts (NFAs) measure the ecological resource use and resource capacity of nations from 1961 to 2016.\nThe calculations in the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts are primarily based on United Nations data sets, including those published by the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, and the UN Statistics Division, as well as the International Energy Agency.\nThe 2019 edition of the NFA features some exciting updates from last year’s 2018 edition:\n\n\n1. The data lag from the UN was shortened from four to three years, giving researchers access to two more years of data (2015, 2016).\n2. The 2019 edition of the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts was produced, for the very first time, under the close observation of the team at York University’s Faculty of Environmental Studies (FES) who is part of the Ecological Footprint Initiative. Going forward, the Ecological Footprint Initiative team in Toronto will be entrusted with producing National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts data with the support of Global Footprint Network, in the context of the partnership created in 2018 by both organizations with a view to ensuring ever more robust and transparent data in the future.\n# National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts 2019 Edition\nTo visualize our data in our data explorer click [here](http://data.footprintnetwork.org/) .\nDataset provides Ecological Footprint per capita data for years 1961-2016 in global hectares (gha).\nEcological Footprint is a measure of how much area of biologically productive land and water an individual, population, or activity requires to produce all the resources it consumes and to absorb the waste it generates, using prevailing technology and resource management practices. The Ecological Footprint is measured in global hectares. Since trade is global, an individual or country's Footprint tracks area from all over the world. Without further specification, Ecological Footprint generally refers to the Ecological Footprint of consumption (rather than only production or export). Ecological Footprint is often referred to in short form as Footprint.\n\n# About this Dataset\nThis data includes total and per capita national biocapacity, ecological footprint of consumption, ecological footprint of production and total area in hectares. This dataset, however, does not include any of our yield factors (national or world) nor any equivalence factors.
